        The Bee Gees were a music group formed in 1958, featuring brothers
        Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. The trio were especially successful as a
        popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and later as
        prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid- to late 1970s.
        The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear
        vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's
        R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid- to late 1970s
        and 1980s. The Bee Gees wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing
        and producing several major hits for other artists and have been
        regarded as one of the most important and influential acts in pop music
        history.

        Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in
        Chorlton, Manchester, England until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they
        formed the skiffle/rock and roll group the Rattlesnakes. The family then
        moved to Redcliffe, in the Moreton Bay Region, Queensland, Australia,
        later to Cribb Island.
